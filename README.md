# Web Crawler and Search Tool

Welcome to our URL discovery and crawling tool, designed to optimize web content extraction and improve data processing efficiency. Below are the main features of our solution:

## Main Features

### URL Discovery and Crawling

Our tool allows for the automatic discovery of relevant URLs from an initial seed. It uses advanced crawling techniques to explore and map websites, ensuring no important content is missed.

### Web Search with Content Extraction

Perform precise web searches and extract the necessary content from the pages found. Our tool is equipped to handle various content formats, including text, images, and metadata.

### Automatic Retries with Exponential Backoff

We implement an automatic retry strategy with exponential backoff to handle temporary failures in web requests. This ensures that failed requests are retried efficiently without overloading the servers.

### Efficient Batch Processing with Built-in Rate Limiting

Our tool supports batch processing of large volumes of data, with built-in rate limiting to comply with web service usage policies. This ensures that requests are made in a controlled and efficient manner.

### Credit Usage Monitoring for Cloud APIs

Keep precise control over the usage of credits for cloud APIs. Our tool monitors credit consumption in real-time, allowing for efficient resource management and avoiding unexpected costs.
